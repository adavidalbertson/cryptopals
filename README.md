# cryptopals

### Solutions to Cryptopals crypto challenges (https://cryptopals.com/), in Go.

Attacks are located in their own package, separate from the protocols they target.
Solutions are in the challenges directory, organized by set.
I tried to keep these as bare-bones as possible, and do the real work in the appropriate packages.

To see a solution in action, navigate to the ```challenge_n``` directory, ```go install```, and run the program with ```challenge_n```.

### About

As a math major, my exposure to cryptology was mostly on the theoretical side.
I took on this project to get a feel for practical crypto, as well as learn a new language.

Why Go?
I work as a web developer, and am most comfortable on the back end, so learning another server language seemed like a good move.
I also wanted to try out a more "modern" language than the ones I've used previously.
